## My process

### Built with

- Vite / React
- Tailwind CSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

- Implementing clickable and hoverable drop-down menus with CSS and JavaScript in React as a component
- Passing the menu data as an object instead of hardcoding it in the component
- Using the `useEffect()` hook in React
- Using `pointer-events: none;` in CSS to bypass triggering the event for unneeded elements (for example an arrow image inside a button element)
- Making an accessible drop down menu by using appropriate HTML elements and ARIA attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` and `aria-labelledby`
- Adding animations to the drop down menu with Tailwind CSS
